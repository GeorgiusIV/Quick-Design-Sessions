# Quick-Design-Sessions
10/10/30/10 Analysis/Design/Coding/Evaluation

Everyday I have done 1-4 sessions of this. 
  I spend 10 minutes creating ideas and asking questions about them. 
  I spend 10 minutes answering those questions and proposing a solution. 
  I spend 30 minutes programming that solution as best I can. 
  I spend 10 minutes evaluating my process.
Overtime this method has evolved; new questions have been introduced, durations have been changed, stages rearranged.

At the time of writing, I typically follow the pattern: read my previous notes, write my recollection, resume developing from there.
  And my current efforts are in: an increased focus on testing, following my evaluations more thoroughly.
